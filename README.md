# Create A Password

## Description

This project creates a randomized password according to the chosen parameters. It allows one to make 
strong passwords with a character length between 8 and 128 that fall into some of the most common criteria required by sites making developing unique passwords simple. It utilizes a combination of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to prompt for the user's desired parameters and displays the generated password in the secondary box. 

## Installation

This project is accessible as a deployed site. The current URL is https://fairleyv.github.io/CreatePassword/

## Usage

    ### 1. The Initial Screen
    
    The initial screen will display a box in the center of the screen containing a secondary box with the words "Your Secure Password" within it. This is where your password will appear replacing the words "Your Secure Password". There is also a button with the words "Generate Password" inside of it. This button sits within the primary box and beneath the secondary box and is the button used to begin the password generating process. 

    ### 2. Click the "Generate Password" Button

    To begin the process click on the red "Generate Password" Button with your left mouse button. This will create an alert at the top of your screen prompting you to set your parameters for your passwords. Follow these steps until you get to the final confirmation screen. 

    ### 3. Confirmation Screen

    Check to see if all of your desired parameters are accurate. If the displayed setting has "true" next to it, then that setting will be included in the password generation. If all desired parameters are accurate confirm the choices. Otherwise click "cancel". This will prompt another screen asking if you would like to try again. If you would like to try again then click "confirm". This will restart the process of setting your parameters. If you would not like to try again then click "cancel", and the alert will close leaving you at the initial screen again. 

    ### 4. Create Password
    
    Once the settings are confirmed, an alert will appear notifying you that your password is being generated. Once acknowledged an alert will appear with the words "Success". Once this alert is acknowledged your password will be displayed in the secondary box in place of the words "Your Secure Password". If you'd like a new password then clicking the "Generate Password" button and going through each of the above steps again will replace the previous password with a new password according to the new parameters chosen.
